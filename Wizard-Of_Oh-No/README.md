a classical rage game swiper. try to slay as many enemies as possible.

since this game isn't close to being done, it is yet to be published.


roadmap:
- 3 different difficulties: Normal, Hard and Nightmare
- (un)fair wave system relying on the difficulty 
- different magicians each having its own attack style, available by purchasing in-game currency or score-based (say get to 500 kills in a single game to unlock a certain magician)
- cool flashy bosses
- more enemy styles (some having more than 1 hp)
- MUCH NEEDED GRAPHICS IMPROVMENTS
