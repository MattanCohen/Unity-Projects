Gameplay Controls:
* hold-touch anywhere on the screen to move the spaceship (and making it shoot)
* pick up power-ups like multy-shot or batch-shot or speed-up etc. 
* shoot enemy spaceships
* avoid touching enemy spaceships




this game is the first game I have ever made.
this is my take on Udemy's the Ultimate Guide to Game Development course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-guide-to-game-development-with-unity/


since this game was my first game ever, out of pure excitment I got cought up and added a few power-ups and enemy behaviour patters myself that change randomaly making the gameplay different than course's intention.
