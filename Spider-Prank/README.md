SpiderPrank


this game was made as part of the Global Game Jam 2022 contest.

I joined the "Beer Sheba Global Game Jam group" as part of the SpiderPrank team.

since the GGJ had the theam "duality", we made it possible for the player to lay "eggs" that turn into enemies (the cats) after a set amount of time, that the player has to kill. so the game rewards laying eggs (creating life) and killing them shortly after (destroying life).
